# LeapScanner
This project is about developing a handheld 3D scanner using Leap Motion(r) controller. The idea of this project is to develop a cheap 3D scanner to scan simple objects to a 3D mesh model. After scanning, the object could be used in a virtual environment like game or simulation system. This simple scanning method may avoid the time consuming and complicated modeling methods of designing objects.
