# LeapScanner
This project is about developing a handheld 3D scanner using Leap MotionⓇ  controller . The idea of this project is to develop a cheap 3D scanner to scan simple objects into a 3D mesh model. After scanning, the object could be used in a virtual environment like game or simulation system. This simple scanning method may avoid the time consuming and complicated modeling methods of designing objects typically followed in the conventional game development and simulatio workflow.The motivation for developing the handheld scanner using Leap MotionⓇ device is to reduce time and cost for modeling of small and complex 3D objects.

After getting this mesh model we can use in games and other simulation envirounment
